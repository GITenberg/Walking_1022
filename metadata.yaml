description: This essay was presented as a lecture by Thoreau in his later years,
  but only published after his death. It's best known for its quote "In wildness is
  the preservation of the world", which has become a rallying cry of the environmental
  movement. But Thoreau means much more by the phrase then most of his modern admirers
  realise. "Wildness" is Nature itself, and humankind is seen as an aspect or manifestation
  of Nature; the rules that apply to one apply to the other.
